                            <div><p> I'm a junior software developer with a passion for back-end programming.  
                            The majority of my studies have been self-directed. I have studied programming passionately in my free time completing various online courses through a number of platforms. This includes CS50, a computer science course through HarvardX, C# Fundamentals which I did through Microsoft Learn, a Cisco cyber security and networking course, 100 days of Code, which was a Python course through Udemy, and a number of Unity game design courses.  Using C# and the Unity Game Engine, I built this forested scene we're currently walking around in.<br />

                            I've recently completed a 12-week Software Engineering Immersive course through General Assembly, through which I have further expanded my knowledge of HTML and CSS, learned JavaScript and the MERN stack as well as revisiting Python and adding Django into the mix.<br />

                            I think my strengths lie in my passion for problem-solving, my attention to detail and my belief that every piece of work that has my name against it is a reflection of my character.  I work hard until I'm satisfied with what I've produced and I enjoy discovering and implementing unique methods to achieve my goals.<br />

                            I'm based in Melbourne and open to working onsite or remotely. Thanks for visiting my website.  If you'd like to know more about me feel free to reach out for a coffee and a chat.<br />
